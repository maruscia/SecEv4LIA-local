Operation tracking and synchronization module.

This module provides components for tracking pipeline operations and
synchronizing state with the SecEv4LIA backend API. It includes:

- Tracker: Main tracking class for per-goal result tracking (recommended)
- StepTracker: Step-level tracking for pipeline steps
- track_step: Context manager for tracking individual steps
- track_operation: Decorator for automatic operation tracking
- TrackingContext: Shared context for tracking state
- Context: Context for tracking a single goal's attack execution

The tracking system is designed to be:
- Modular: Each component has a single responsibility
- Reusable: Works with any attack or pipeline implementation
- Optional: Gracefully degrades when tracking is disabled
- Thread-safe: Safe for concurrent operations

Result Organization:
- Tracker: Creates one Result per goal/datapoint, with multiple Traces
  capturing the full attack journey (preferred for attack techniques)
- StepTracker: Creates traces for pipeline steps (useful for high-level tracking)

The Tracker approach ensures each Result represents a meaningful datapoint
(e.g., one attack goal) rather than individual LLM interactions.
