Shared attack templates library.

This module provides reusable attack prompt templates that can be used
across different objectives and techniques.

Classes:
    AttackTemplates: Centralized library of attack prompt templates

Constants:
    REFUSAL_PATTERNS: Regex patterns for detecting model refusals
    SUCCESS_PATTERNS: Regex patterns for detecting successful attacks

Usage:
