Metrics and evaluation analysis utilities.

This module provides reusable metric calculation and analysis
functions for attack evaluation.

Functions:
    calculate_success_rate: Overall success rate from results
    calculate_confidence_score: Average confidence from results
    group_by_goal: Group results by goal
    calculate_per_goal_metrics: Per-goal metric breakdown
    generate_summary_report: Comprehensive summary report

Usage:
