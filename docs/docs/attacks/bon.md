# BoN (Best-of-N Jailbreaking)

BoN is a stochastic black-box attack that **generates N randomly augmented versions** of a harmful prompt — using word scrambling, random capitalization, and ASCII perturbation — and picks the best candidate that bypasses the target model's safety mechanisms. The technique exploits the observation that random text mutations can break safety classifiers while preserving semantic meaning for the LLM.

## Overview

BoN operates without an external attacker model. The harmful goal is augmented with random text transformations controlled by a single strength parameter σ (sigma), and multiple augmented candidates are tested in parallel against the target. After each step, the best candidate is **evaluated by a judge** (e.g. HarmBench) to determine if it constitutes a successful jailbreak. If the judge confirms success, the search **terminates early**. Otherwise, the attack continues to the next step until the budget is exhausted.

### Research Foundation

BoN is based on the paper:

> **"Best-of-N Jailbreaking"**  
> Hughes et al., 2024  
> [arXiv:2412.03556](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03556)

The paper demonstrates that simple random text augmentations can achieve high attack success rates across multiple frontier models with minimal computational cost.

### Attack Flow

1. **Augment** — for each search step, generate K augmented versions of the goal using randomly-seeded text transformations (word scrambling, case toggling, ASCII shifts).
2. **Send** — all K candidates are sent to the target model in parallel.
3. **Select** — the best candidate is selected by response length (as a proxy for non-refusal).
4. **Judge** — the selected best candidate is immediately evaluated by the configured judge(s) (e.g. HarmBench).
5. **Early Stop** — if the judge confirms a jailbreak (score > 0), the search terminates and the result is marked as **success**.
6. **Repeat** — if the judge says no jailbreak, move to the next step with fresh seeds.
7. **Fail** — if all steps are exhausted without a jailbreak, the attack is marked as **failed**.

## Text Augmentations

Three augmentations can be combined independently, all controlled by σ:

| Augmentation | Config Key | Effect | Probability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Word Scrambling** | `word_scrambling` | Shuffles middle characters of words > 3 chars | `σ^(1/2)` per word |
| **Random Capitalisation** | `random_capitalization` | Randomly toggles letter case | `σ^(1/2)` per char |
| **ASCII Perturbation** | `ascii_perturbation` | Shifts printable ASCII chars by ±1 | `σ^3` per char |

**Examples** (σ = 0.4):

| Original | Word Scrambling | Random Capitalisation | ASCII Perturbation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"The quick brown fox"` | `"The qiuck bwron fox"` | `"ThE qUick bRoWn fOx"` | `"Tge quick brown fox"` |

#### Top-Level Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |

### Shared Goal Category Classifier

All attacks accept a top-level `category_classifier` block. It runs once per goal to attach a normalized category to tracking metadata (independent from judge scoring).

```python
"category_classifier": {
    "identifier": "gemma3:4b",
    "endpoint": "http://localhost:11434",
    "agent_type": "OLLAMA",
    "api_key": None,
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "temperature": 0.0
}
```

### Parallelization

BoN is **highly parallelizable** within each search step:

- **Within a step**: all K candidates are independent (different random seeds) and sent to the target concurrently. Set `batch_size` to match `num_concurrent_k` for maximum throughput.
- **Across steps**: steps are sequential — step N+1 starts after step N completes. The judge evaluates the best candidate of each step, enabling **early termination** as soon as a jailbreak is confirmed.
- **Across goals**: `goal_batch_size` controls how many goals are processed in each macro-batch.

**Recommended**: set `batch_size = num_concurrent_k` for optimal parallelism.

## Notes

- **No attacker LLM needed**: unlike PAIR or AutoDAN-Turbo, BoN uses only the target model plus a judge. No attacker/scorer model is required.
- **Inline judge evaluation**: the judge is called **inside** the search loop, not as a separate post-processing step. This enables early termination and avoids wasting queries on steps after a jailbreak is already found.
- **Sigma tuning**: the default σ = 0.4 works well across most models. Lower values produce subtler augmentations; higher values produce more aggressive mutations that may reduce semantic coherence.
- **Deterministic seeds**: each candidate uses a deterministic seed derived from the step and candidate index, ensuring reproducible results given the same configuration.
- **Scalability**: increasing `n_steps` and `num_concurrent_k` improves attack success rate at the cost of more target model queries. Total queries per goal = `n_steps × num_concurrent_k` in the worst case (less if early stopped by inline judge).
