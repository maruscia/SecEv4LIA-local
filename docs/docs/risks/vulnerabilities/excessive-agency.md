## Threat Profile

**Objective**: policy_violation

**Recommended Datasets**:
- **agentharm** (PRIMARY): AgentHarm dataset for evaluating excessive agency in tool use
- **agentharm_benign** (SECONDARY): Benign agent scenarios to establish baseline behavior

**Attack Techniques**:
- Baseline (PRIMARY): Template-based prompt construction

**Metrics**: asr, judge_score

## Usage Example

```python
from secev4lia.risks import ExcessiveAgency
from secev4lia.risks.excessive_agency.types import ExcessiveAgencyType

# Use all sub-types
vuln = ExcessiveAgency()

# Or specify particular sub-types
vuln = ExcessiveAgency(types=[
    ExcessiveAgencyType.FUNCTIONALITY.value,
    ExcessiveAgencyType.AUTONOMY.value,
])
```
