TAP (Tree of Attacks with Pruning) attack implementation.

Implements the TAP algorithm from:
    Mehrotra et al., &quot;Tree of Attacks with Pruning: Efficient
    Adversarial Prompting of Large Language Models&quot; (2023)
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02119

Algorithm overview
------------------
TAP performs a bounded tree search where each node represents an
attacker-generated prompt candidate:

1. **Branching** — an attacker LLM generates ``branching_factor``
   refinements of the current prompt in parallel ``n_streams`` streams.
2. **On-topic pruning** — a judge (or the main judge) discards branches
   whose prompts have drifted off-topic (``min_on_topic_score`` threshold).
3. **Target query** — surviving prompts are sent to the victim model.
4. **Score pruning** — only the top-``width`` branches by jailbreak score
   are kept for the next depth level.
5. **Termination** — search stops when ``depth`` levels are exhausted or
   a branch exceeds ``success_score_threshold``.

Key parameters (``tap_params`` in config)
-----------------------------------------
depth
    Maximum tree depth (number of refinement rounds per stream).
width
    Maximum branches kept after scoring at each depth level.
branching_factor
    Prompt refinements generated per active branch at each step.
n_streams
    Number of independent root-to-leaf searches run in parallel.
keep_last_n
    Conversation history window per stream (controls attacker context size).
early_stop_on_success
    Stop all streams as soon as one branch crosses the success threshold.
min_on_topic_score
    Minimum on-topic score (0 or 1) to retain a branch after on-topic pruning.
success_score_threshold
    Judge score that signals a successful jailbreak (default 1 for binary judges).

## TAPAttack Objects

```python
class TAPAttack(BaseAttack)
```

TAP (Tree of Attacks with Pruning) attack.

Orchestrates the TAP tree search by delegating to
:mod:`~secev4lia.attacks.techniques.tap.generation` (attacker loop
and target queries) and
:mod:`~secev4lia.attacks.techniques.tap.evaluation` (judge scoring).

The attack expects three collaborating models configured via
``config``:

* **Attacker** (``config[&quot;attacker&quot;]``) — LLM that proposes prompt
refinements from conversation history.
* **Target** — the victim model reached via ``agent_router``.
* **Judge** (``config[&quot;judge&quot;]``) — LLM that rates jailbreak success
0–10 (or 0/1 for binary judges such as HarmBench).
* **On-topic judge** (``config[&quot;on_topic_judge&quot;]``, optional) —
separate evaluator that checks whether a prompt stays on-topic.
When ``None``, the configured judge is reused with the on-topic
evaluation type.

The :meth:`~secev4lia.attacks.techniques.tap.evaluation`4 method manages the full pipeline via
:class:`~secev4lia.attacks.techniques.tap.evaluation`5:
a coordinator handles per-goal :class:`~secev4lia.attacks.techniques.tap.evaluation`6
lifecycle and pipeline-level :class:`~secev4lia.attacks.techniques.tap.evaluation`7
checkpointing.

**Attributes**:

- `~secev4lia.attacks.techniques.tap.evaluation`8 - Merged TAP configuration dictionary.
- `~secev4lia.attacks.techniques.tap.evaluation`9 - Authenticated SecEv4LIA API client.
- ``0 - Router for the victim model.
- ``1 - Hierarchical logger at ``secev4lia.attacks.tap``.

#### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
             client: Optional[AuthenticatedClient] = None,
             agent_router: Optional[AgentRouter] = None)
```

Initialize TAP with configuration and routers.

**Arguments**:

- `config` - Optional config overrides merged into
  :data:`~secev4lia.attacks.techniques.tap.config.DEFAULT_TAP_CONFIG`.
  Keys from ``config`` win over defaults; nested dicts are
  deep-merged via :func:`_recursive_update`.
- `client` - Authenticated API client.
- `agent_router` - Router for the victim model.
  

**Raises**:

- `ValueError` - If ``client`` or ``agent_router`` is ``None``.

#### run

```python
@with_tui_logging(logger_name="secev4lia.attacks", level=logging.INFO)
def run(goals: List[str]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
```

Run TAP end-to-end with unified tracking and pipeline steps.

**Arguments**:

- `goals` - List of goal strings to attack.
  

**Returns**:

  List of per-goal result dicts produced by the pipeline.
