FlipAttack generation and execution module.

Generates flipped prompts by calling :meth:`FlipAttack.generate` on the
attack instance passed via ``config[&quot;_self&quot;]``, then executes them against
the target model via SecEv4LIA&#x27;s AgentRouter.

Result Tracking:
    Uses Tracker (passed via config[&quot;_tracker&quot;]) to add interaction traces
    per goal during generation and execution.

#### execute

```python
def execute(goals: List[str], agent_router: AgentRouter,
            config: Dict[str, Any], logger: logging.Logger) -> List[Dict]
```
