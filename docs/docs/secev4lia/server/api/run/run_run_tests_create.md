#### sync\_detailed

```python
def sync_detailed(*, client: AuthenticatedClient,
                  body: RunRequest) -> Response[Run]
```

ViewSet for managing Run instances.
Primarily for listing/retrieving runs.
Creation of server-side runs is handled by custom actions.
Runs initiated from Attack definitions are created via AttackViewSet.

SDK-primary endpoint - API Key authentication is recommended for programmatic access.
Auth0 authentication is supported as fallback for web dashboard use.
This is a core SDK operation for executing and monitoring security tests.

**Arguments**:

- `body` _RunRequest_ - Serializer for the Run model, used for both input and output.
  

**Raises**:

- `errors.UnexpectedStatus` - If the server returns an undocumented status code and Client.raise_on_unexpected_status is True.
- `httpx.TimeoutException` - If the request takes longer than Client.timeout.
  

**Returns**:

  Response[Run]
