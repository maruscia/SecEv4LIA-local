## SecEv4LIA Objects

```python
class SecEv4LIA()
```

The primary client for orchestrating security assessments with SecEv4LIA.

This class serves as the main entry point to the SecEv4LIA library, providing
a high-level interface for:
- Configuring victim agents that will be assessed.
- Defining and selecting attack strategies.
- Executing automated security tests against the configured agents.
- Retrieving and handling test results.

It encapsulates complexities such as agent registration
with the local backend (via `AgentRouter`), and the dynamic dispatch of various
attack methodologies.

**Attributes**:

- `router` - An `AgentRouter` instance managing the agent&#x27;s representation
  in the SecEv4LIA backend.
- `attack_strategies` - A dictionary mapping strategy names to their
  `AttackStrategy` implementations.

#### \_\_init\_\_

```python
def __init__(endpoint: str,
             name: Optional[str] = None,
             agent_type: Union[AgentTypeEnum, str] = AgentTypeEnum.UNKNOWN,
             raise_on_unexpected_status: bool = False,
             timeout: Optional[float] = None,
             metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
             target_config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
             adapter_operational_config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None)
```

Initializes the SecEv4LIA client and prepares it for interaction.

This constructor sets up the local storage backend, loads default
prompts, resolves the agent type, and initializes the agent router
to ensure the agent is known to the backend. It also prepares available
attack strategies.

**Arguments**:

- `endpoint` - The target application&#x27;s endpoint URL. This is the primary
  interface that the configured agent will interact with or represent
  during security tests.
- `name` - An optional descriptive name for the agent being configured.
  If not provided, a default name might be assigned or behavior might
  depend on the specific backend agent management policies.
- `agent_type` - Specifies the type of the agent. This can be provided
  as an `AgentTypeEnum` member (e.g., `AgentTypeEnum.GOOGLE_ADK`) or
  as a string identifier (e.g., &quot;google-adk&quot;, &quot;litellm&quot;).
  String values are automatically converted to the corresponding
  `AgentTypeEnum` member. Defaults to `AgentTypeEnum.UNKNOWN` if
  not specified or if an invalid string is provided.
- `raise_on_unexpected_status` - If set to `True`, the API client will
  raise an exception for any HTTP status codes that are not typically
  expected for a successful operation. Defaults to `False`.
- `name`0 - The timeout duration in seconds for API requests made by the
  authenticated client. Defaults to `name`1 (which might mean a
  default timeout from the underlying HTTP library is used).
- `name`2 - Optional dictionary containing agent-specific metadata.
- `name`3 - Optional default request settings for the configured
  victim model. This is the preferred place to define target-side
  generation defaults such as `name`4, `name`5,
  and `name`0.
- `name`7 - Optional configuration for the agent adapter.

#### attack\_strategies

```python
@property
def attack_strategies() -> Dict[str, Any]
```

Lazy-loaded attack strategies dictionary.

#### hack

```python
def hack(attack_config: Dict[str, Any],
         run_config_override: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
         fail_on_run_error: bool = True,
         _tui_app: Optional[Any] = None,
         _tui_log_callback: Optional[Any] = None) -> Any
```

Executes a specified attack strategy against the configured victim agent.

This method serves as the primary action command for initiating an attack.
It identifies the appropriate attack strategy based on `attack_config`,
ensures the victim agent (managed by `self.router`) is ready, and then
delegates the execution to the chosen strategy.

**Arguments**:

- `attack_config` - A dictionary containing parameters specific to the
  chosen attack type. Must include an &#x27;attack_type&#x27; key that maps
  to a registered strategy (e.g., &quot;advprefix&quot;). Other keys provide
  configuration for that strategy (e.g., &#x27;category&#x27;, &#x27;prompt_text&#x27;).
- `run_config_override` - An optional dictionary that can override default
  run configurations. The specifics depend on the attack strategy
  and backend capabilities.
- `fail_on_run_error` - If `True` (the default), an exception will be
  raised if the attack run encounters an error and fails. If `False`,
  errors might be suppressed or handled differently by the strategy.
  

**Returns**:

  The result returned by the `execute` method of the chosen attack
  strategy. The nature of this result is strategy-dependent.
  

**Raises**:

- `ValueError` - If the &#x27;attack_type&#x27; is missing from `attack_config` or
  if the specified &#x27;attack_type&#x27; is not a supported/registered
  strategy.
- `self.router`0 - For issues during backend
  agent operations, or other unexpected errors during the attack process.
