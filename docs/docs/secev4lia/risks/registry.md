Central catalogue of every built-in vulnerability. Each vulnerability
lives in its own folder under ``risks/``.

To add a new vulnerability:
1. Create a new folder under ``risks/`` (e.g. ``my_vulnerability/``)
2. Implement ``types.py`` and ``vulnerabilities.py``
3. Import and register it here

#### get\_all\_vulnerability\_names

```python
def get_all_vulnerability_names() -> List[str]
```

Return all registered vulnerability names.
